# AoC 2025

Done in APL.

See parent [README.md](../README.md) for setup.

## Day 1

Both parts done the same way, except part 2 breaks up rotations into 1 click moves.

## Day 2

Regex...

## Day 3

Dynamic programming using max scan.

## Day 4

Simple stencil solution.

## Day 5

Merge ranges using max scan and ⌸ to remove overlapping ranges. Part 1 is then trivial with ⍸ (interval index). Part 2 is similarly trivial, sum of differences. Since input numbers are sufficiently large, `⎕FR` must be bumped.
